# Stock Breakout Analyzer - Development Process

## Project Overview

A Streamlit-based web application for analyzing stock breakouts based on volume and price thresholds. The app helps identify and analyze potential breakout opportunities in the stock market.

## Development Timeline

Total Development Time: ~2 hours

### Phase 1: Initial Setup (30 minutes)

- Set up project structure
- Created virtual environment
- Installed initial dependencies (yfinance, pandas, streamlit)
- Basic project scaffolding

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (45 minutes)

- Implemented data fetching using yfinance API
- Developed breakout analysis logic:
  - 20-day volume average calculation
  - Volume threshold comparison
  - Price change calculations
  - Return analysis for holding periods

### Phase 3: UI Development (30 minutes)

- Created Streamlit interface
- Added input parameters:
  - Stock symbol
  - Date range selection
  - Volume and price thresholds
  - Holding period
- Implemented results display and CSV export

### Phase 4: Refinement (15 minutes)

- Added error handling
- Improved data validation
- Enhanced UI/UX
- Added helpful tooltips

## Data Sources

- **Stock Data**: Yahoo Finance API (via yfinance)
  - Historical price data
  - Volume information
  - Daily OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) prices

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Date Range Handling

**Challenge**: Initially encountered issues with future dates causing data fetch errors.
**Solution**: Implemented date validation to prevent selecting future dates and added proper error messages.

### 2. Performance Optimization

**Challenge**: Long processing times for extensive date ranges.
**Solution**:

- Optimized DataFrame operations
- Added loading spinners for better UX
- Implemented efficient data filtering

### 3. Streamlit incompatibility

**Challenge**: yfinance was not working with streamlit
**Solution**:

- Added cache directory to stored cached data
